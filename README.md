CASE STUDY
Designing for: Web application (Desktop, Browser) and mobile application
User Persona: John is an author and a power user of Expedia. He travels a lot and book tickets via
Expedia only either on phone or web browser.
User pain-point: John travels every month and likes to travel via only Boeing 737 planes. But Expedia
never mentions this and neither do have any filter for same. He gets to know this only after booking
is done via the actual airline due to which he has to cancel the ticket or request airline to switch his
ticket to Boeing 737 plane. This is quite frustrating to him.
Problem Statement for you: Provide solution to above problem for Expedia (Desktop, Browser,
Mobile app) which will cover the use case mentioned above.
